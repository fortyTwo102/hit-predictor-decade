after the EPIPHANY to actually got and read the damned Spotify API search Documentations (Im a dumbfuck)

1. I'll have to find out the genres that I can put in the query. For that I'll make a script
that lists all the unique genres of a particular decade from the failed songs list. DONE

2. In my script to fetch all the tracks within a decade range + unique genre, the output will be
just the track IDs. DONE

3. I'll sanitize it by excluding all the tracks by an artist that has ever appeared on a billboard song.
The output will be a smaller list of tracks IDs. DONE

4. A script will fetch all the tracks of the those albums. DONE

5. Now, the fetching script will be modified. I'll download all of the features. Saved using pickle. DONE

6. I'll choose between the features to make the dataset that I need for the models. DONE

7. Upload the final dataset on Kaggle, reddit and places.

If it was easy, anyone would do it.
